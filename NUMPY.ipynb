        "NumPy Array: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical and logical operations that can be performed on arrays. This includes element-wise operations, broadcasting, and linear algebra functions.\n",
        "List: Lists are more general-purpose and don't have built-in support for advanced mathematical operations. You'd have to use loops or list comprehensions to perform similar tasks, which can be slower and more cumbersome.\n",
